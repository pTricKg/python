## creating anonomys functions with lambda
lambda variable: expression

'''Python allows for a style of programming called functional programming, 		which means that you're allowed to pass functions around just as if they 	were variables or values. '''

''' lambda x: x % 3 == 0
Is the same as

def by_three(x):
    return x % 3 == 0'''
